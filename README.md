## üìñ Introduction

**DeepFakes** are synthetic media in which a person‚Äôs likeness is manipulated using AI techniques such as **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. These videos can be misleading and nearly indistinguishable from authentic footage.

This project presents a DeepFake detection system utilizing:

- **VGG16** for visual feature extraction  
- **CNN** for frame-wise classification  
- **Dlib** for facial landmark detection  
- **OpenCV** for frame processing and face detection  

## üåê Impact of DeepFake Videos

- **Misinformation & Propaganda**: Spread of fake news, altering public opinion.  
- **Celebrity & Political Scams**: Used in impersonation or defamation campaigns.  
- **Security & Privacy Breaches**: Threats to biometric authentication systems.  

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Develop an AI-powered system to detect DeepFake videos.
- Use **OpenCV** to extract frames and detect faces.
- Apply **Dlib** to extract facial landmarks for tampering evidence.
- Use **VGG16** for deep feature extraction and a **CNN** to classify video frames.
- Aggregate frame-level predictions to classify an entire video.
- Deploy a user-friendly interface for real-time detection.

## üîÑ Pre-processing Workflow

1. Convert input video to frames using **OpenCV**.  
2. Detect faces in each frame.  
3. Use **Dlib** to extract **68 facial landmarks**.  
4. Resize all faces to `224√ó224` pixels.  
5. Normalize the pixel values.  
6. Store features and landmark metadata for model input.

## üîç Prediction Workflow

1. User uploads a video via frontend.  
2. Backend extracts frames and processes them with OpenCV.  
3. **Dlib** landmarks are used to check inconsistencies in facial movements.  
4. **VGG16** extracts frame features.  
5. Frames are passed through the trained **CNN**.  
6. Frame-level predictions are aggregated using a majority vote or average score.  
7. Final classification (Real or Fake) is returned to the user.

## üß† Models Used

### VGG16 (Feature Extractor)
- Pre-trained on ImageNet.
